I'll reimplement the API response using the Vercel SDK for OpenAI. I'll update the `app/api/chat/route.ts` file to use the new SDK. Here's the updated implementation:

<ReactProject id="OpenAI Chat API">

```tsx file="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from "ai";
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Create an OpenAI API client (that's edge friendly!)
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || "",
});

// IMPORTANT! Set the runtime to edge
export const runtime = "edge";

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  // Extract the `messages` from the body of the request
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  // Ask OpenAI for a streaming chat completion given the prompt
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    stream: true,
    messages: messages.map((message: any) => ({
      content: message.content,
      role: message.role,
    })),
  });

  // Convert the response into a friendly text-stream
  const stream = OpenAIStream(response);

  // Respond with the stream
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
}
```

</ReactProject>

In this updated implementation, we've made the following changes:

1. Replaced the `openai-edge` import with the new Vercel SDK `import OpenAI from "openai"`.
2. Updated the OpenAI client initialization to use the new SDK syntax.
3. Updated the `createChatCompletion` method to use the new SDK's `chat.completions.create` method.

The rest of the code remains the same, including the use of `OpenAIStream` and `StreamingTextResponse` from the `ai` package.

This implementation uses the latest Vercel SDK for OpenAI, which provides a more streamlined and up-to-date way of interacting with the OpenAI API. It's designed to work well with edge runtimes and provides better type safety and error handling.

The other files in the project remain unchanged, as they don't directly interact with the OpenAI API. The `app/page.tsx` file, which contains the frontend logic for the chat interface, will continue to work with this updated API route without any modifications.
